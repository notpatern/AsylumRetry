Synopsis
-------------


You are the protagonist of this game. The one and only character. You find yourself in a museum corridor filled with 4 frames. The first frame is filled with the painting of a game. In order to fill the next frame and access the next game, you need to finish the first one. You may want to explore the museum and leave its confines, but that is not possible. As hard as one might try, one cannot leave the museum. Unless ~it~ speaks to you.

Ludum Dare 54
-------------


This jam's theme was "Limited Space" so our team decided we wanted to be original and find a twist to this theme. 



- First, the museum:

The museum is Infinite and yet your are stuck in it's single corridor, doomed to view the same paintings over and over. In this, you, the player, are limited to the museum's space.



- Then, the frames:

The Frames contain games, and so to speak, the games are contained by the frames. What we mean by this is that unlike 3D Games or Typical side scrollers like Celeste, the game space is limited by the frame's border. So everything happens on your screen.



- Lastly, the Asylum:

We can't elaborate on that one. You'll have to play the game ;D



We had a lot of fun taking part in this jam and we hope you'll have fun playing our game!
